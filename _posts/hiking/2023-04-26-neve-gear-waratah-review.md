I recently purchased a [Waratah quilt from Neve gear][waratah]. This is my first quilt purchase and knocked a whopping 450g off my sleeping bag weight. Seeing as Neve gear is locally manufactured and therefore lightly reviewed, I thought I would share my experience with the quilt so far.

## Configuration

I opted for the 950FP Goose down fill (alternate option 850FP Duck) with a comfort rating of -5, a height to fit 6'10, wide width, and 25g of overfill. 

## Construction

The quilt is made of a 10D material (believe Nylon?) which is pleasantly soft to touch. I was very happy sleeping with this material against bare skin, it does feel a little delicate but like many things you carry you just need to be careful and it won't be an issue.

The quilt features vertical baffles for the majority of the quilt, switching to a horizontal baffle toward the feet. I did not notice any down migration or cold spots with the baffles appearing to be of appropriate size. The stitching was very neat with the overall finish of the product being very impressive. The footbox features a drawcord to cinch tight, with a footbox collar to prevent drafts. During my testing I did not notice any drafts from the footbox.

The neck has two pop buttons that are used to secure the quilt with a drawcord around the collar to cinch everything in. This was very comfortable and helps keep the warmth in all night. The quilt also comes with two supplied straps to secure the quilt to your sleeping pad, not much to say about these other than they worked exactly as they should!

## Testing

I purchased the -5 version of the quilt, my GoVee hung outside the tent recorded temperatures as low as -6 on a recent overnighter in KNP:

This quilt was paired with a large Seat to Summit comfort light insulated pad with an R value of 3.7, however as I was pitched on thick alpine grass this does seem to mitigate some heat transfer through the ground. I also wore a set of thermals (40% polyester, 33% merino, 26% polypropylene) and a light beanie (wool/polyester blend).

Despite temperatures plummeting as soon as the sun vanished, the quilt kept me warm all night. Fearing the alpine cold I cinched the quilt tight, hunkering down only to find that I was *too* warm and needed to ease off a bit. The recommended wide width provided me with ample room to switch from one side to the other without feeling restricted and having come from using a mummy sleeping bag previously I can understand why 'active' sleepers feel much more comfortable with a quilt. 

During the night there were only 2 times that I felt cold - once when my pad slide to the edge of the tent and I ended up pressed against my (rather chilly) hiking pole supporting the tent, and once when my pad deflated at 5am and I had to leave the safety of the quilt to reinflate it. I feel I could have comfortably pushed this quilt at least a few more degrees without changing my setup at all, although I am a warmer sleeper, so overall the comfort rating seems to be quite accurate.

## Parting Thoughts

Overall, I think this is a well-designed, well made, configurable, and performant quilt. Having the ability to customize the quilt to be perfect for your situation (even if you're tall) is very much appreciated and I'm happy with all the choices I made. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend buying a quilt from Neve Gear - locally made, beautifully made, and wonderfully performant.
